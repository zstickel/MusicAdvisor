<p>Sometimes we have a hierarchy of classes with one <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3577" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a base class, also known as a superclass or parent class, is a class that is extended by another class, known as a subclass or derived class. | It serves as a blueprint for the subclass, providing it with inherited fields and methods. A parent class can have multiple child classes, but a child class can only have one parent class due to Java's single inheritance feature. The parent class reference can be used to refer to any subclass object derived from that superclass. An abstract class is often used as a base class in a hierarchy, and it represents an abstract concept that is used as a base class for subclasses.">base class</a> (or interface) and several subclasses, and we need to create a new subclass object depending on its type. Instead of writing a <code class="language-java">new</code> operator in client code where we will use the objects, it is convenient to encapsulate the code for creating objects in a separate place and call it from the client code. These places are known as <strong>factories</strong> that produce instances of classes related to the same hierarchy. They allow us to simplify the client code and protect it from changes when new classes are added to the hierarchy.</p>
<p>So, a <strong>factory</strong> is a way of creating objects when one part of a program (a class or a method) creates objects and another one processes them.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of factories: <strong>static factory</strong>, <strong>simple factory</strong>, <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3577" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a factory method is a design pattern that provides a way to delegate the instantiation of a class to a subclass. | It allows the class to delegate the responsibility of creating class instances or class hierarchy to the subclass. The factory method pattern consists of four components: Creator, Product, ConcreteCreator, and ConcreteProduct. The Creator declares an abstract or virtual method for creating a product, and the subclass implements this method in its own way. Factory methods encapsulate the code for creating objects of a hierarchy in a special place (factory), making it easier to understand and maintain. They also protect the client code from changes in the class hierarchy. This pattern is useful when we have a hierarchy of classes with one base class or interface and several subclasses, and we need to create a new subclass object depending on its type. Instead of writing a switch-case statement in client code where we will use the object, it is convenient to encapsulate the code for creating objects in a separate place and call it from the client code.">factory method</a></strong> and <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3577" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an abstract factory is a creational design pattern that encapsulates the creation process of related or dependent objects. | It provides an interface or abstract class for creating a family of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. The abstract factory is based on composition, where object creation occurs in a method that is accessed through the factory interface. This pattern ensures low coupling by decreasing the concrete dependency of classes in the running code, allowing for the creation of related objects while keeping the code maintainable and flexible.">abstract factory</a></strong>. In this topic, we will study only the first two; they are often referred to as <em>idioms</em> rather than <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3577" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem that occurs in software design. | It provides a general template for how to solve a problem, rather than a specific implementation. The Strategy pattern, for example, is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one in a separate class, and makes them interchangeable within that family. This allows for easier addition of new algorithms and more concise code, by moving algorithm execution into their own classes. The Command pattern, another behavioral design pattern, decouples the logic between a command and its consumer by encapsulating all the data related to a command in one object.">design patterns</a>. But the latter two are real design patterns that rely on similar principles as those idioms.</p>
<h5 id="static-factory-idiom">Static factory idiom</h5>
<p>As an example, we will consider the following hierarchy of computers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Computer {
    
    private long ram;
    private long cpu;
    
    // getters and setters
}

class PC extends Computer { 
    
    // additional members
}

class Laptop extends Computer { 
    
    // additional members
}</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The static factory</strong> is the simplest factory that we can write. It has one static method which creates objects of the hierarchy. The method takes a required type as a string or enum argument and returns a corresponding subclass instance through the base class.</p>
<p>To create new computers, we invoke the static factory passing a required type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class ComputerStaticFactory {
    
    public static Computer newInstance(String type) {
        if (type.equals("Computer")) {
            return new Computer();
        } else if (type.equals("PC")) {
            return new PC();
        } else if (type.equals("Laptop")) {
            return new Laptop();
        }
        return null; // if not a suitable type
    }
}</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Depending on the passed type, a suitable branch will work. We also can write the same using <code class="language-java">switch</code>.</p>
<p>The following client code creates two computers: a laptop and a PC:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class FactoryClient {
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        
        Computer pc = ComputerStaticFactory.newInstance("PC");
        System.out.println(pc instanceof PC); // prints "true"
       
        Computer laptop = ComputerStaticFactory.newInstance("Laptop");
        System.out.println(laptop instanceof Laptop); // prints "true"
    }
} </code></pre>
<p>It is not difficult to declare a new class that extends <code class="language-java">Computer</code> and modify the factory to create instances of a new class.</p>
<p>There are several possible implementation features:</p>
<ul><li><p>the method <code class="language-java">newInstance</code> of <code class="language-java">ComputerStaticFactory</code> takes an enum type to restrict possible values;</p></li><li><p>the method <code class="language-java">newInstance</code> throws an exception if an unsuitable type is passed instead of returning <code class="language-java">null</code>;</p></li><li><p>move the method <code class="language-java">newInstance</code> directly to the base of the hierarchy: <code class="language-java">Computer</code> class;</p></li><li><p>a factory can have multiple methods that produce instances of different classes or an instance of a default class.</p></li></ul>
<h5 id="simple-factory-idiom">Simple factory idiom</h5>
<p>The simple factory idioms differ from the static factory because the method for creating objects is non-static.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class ComputerFactory {
    
    // it may contain some fields
    
    public Computer newInstance(String type) {
        if (type.equals("Computer")) {
            return new Computer();
        } else if (type.equals("PC")) {
            return new PC();
        } else if (type.equals("Laptop")) {
            return new Laptop();
        }
        return null;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>In the client code, we should create an instance of the factory and then invoke <em>newInstance</em> as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">ComputerFactory factory = new ComputerFactory();
Computer pc = factory.newInstance("PC");</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>The simple factory idiom has the same features as the static factory. But, unlike the static factory, it is possible to create multiple differently parameterized factories to control instantiating. You can also subclass the factory and override its non-static method that is used to create other factories.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>We have considered two factory idioms in action: <strong>static factory</strong> and <strong>simple factory</strong>. They are not really design patterns, but both are nevertheless useful in practice; other factories rely pretty much on the same principles.</p>
<p>According to the principles, we encapsulate the code for creating objects of a hierarchy in a special place (factory). A factory has a method that takes a type of the required object as its parameter and returns a suitable instance to the client code. It protects the client code from changes in the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3577" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a class hierarchy is a way of organizing classes in a parent-child relationship, where a child class inherits properties and methods from its parent class, also known as the superclass. | This mechanism enables code reuse and facilitates the building of a class hierarchy. In the context of a company's activity, for example, a class hierarchy could include a base class with common data fields such as name, year of birth, and address. Derived classes could then add additional fields specific to their purpose, such as a contract number and status for a client class, or start date of work and salary for an employee class. In Java, a class can only inherit from one superclass, but a superclass can have multiple subclasses. It's important to note that constructors are not inherited, but the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass. When working with class hierarchies, you can refer to a subclass object in two ways: using a subclass reference or using a superclass reference. The latter allows you to refer to any subclass using a superclass reference variable.">class hierarchy</a> and makes it simpler to understand and maintain.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that a factory may have multiple clients that need to create objects. They do not need to duplicate the same code that calls the <code class="language-java">new</code> operator to make an instance.</p>
