<h2>Anonymous classes properties</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p> As you remember, there are <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an anonymous class is a small class that implements an interface or extends another class (concrete or abstract) and is declared and instantiated at the same time, without the need to declare a new named class. | It is called anonymous because it doesn't have a name identifier. Anonymous class enables you to declare and instantiate a class in a single statement, which is useful when you need to use a class that overrides some methods of another class or interface only once. The syntax of an anonymous class is similar to a constructor call, except that it contains a class definition in a block of code.">anonymous classes</a></strong> in the world of Java. They don't have name identifiers and they enable you to declare and instantiate a class at the same time. But you didn't think that the whole theory was covered in the first topic, did you?<br/>
So, today is a special day — you will finally learn all the nuances about anonymous classes!</p>
<h5 id="how-to-create">How to create?</h5>
<p>The most popular way to create an anonymous class is to implement an interface and you have seen it already. So, now let's try something new — let's create an anonymous class that inherits from another class.</p>
<p>Imagine a human: they have a brain and many-many thoughts in it. Every couple of seconds they produce a new thought. And we want to describe it in Java language. So, how will we do it?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">abstract class HumanThought {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("This is a very important thought.");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is our superclass <code class="language-java">HumanThought</code> that has one method for printing the standard thought. And now anonymous classes will help us. By inheriting from <code class="language-java">HumanThought</code> we may have as many different thoughts as we want — and that's all without new <code class="language-java">.java</code> files.</p>
<p>All new thoughts would be children of our superclass and will have their own method print:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Human {

    public void takeMilkshake() {

        // creation of anonymous class by inheriting from class HumanThought
        HumanThought thought = new HumanThought() {
            public void print() {
                System.out.println("What to take? Chocolate or strawberry milkshake..");
            }
        };
        thought.print();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>And if we wanted to create an actual human and invoke method <code class="language-java">takeMilkshake</code> — what would be the output?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Human human = new Human();
        human.takeMilkshake();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you are thinking the right thought:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">What to take? Chocolate or strawberry milkshake..</code></pre>
<p>And have you noticed that class <code class="language-java">HumanThought</code> is abstract? Yes, it is — don't forget that we can create an anonymous class by inheriting from both: <strong>concrete</strong> and <strong>abstract</strong> classes.</p>
<p>But to become a master in programming you should get acquainted with another case of creating anonymous classes: when we create an anonymous class and pass it in a constructor as an argument.</p>
<p>So, what is going on in our example below? Firstly, <code class="language-java">Thread</code> is a standard Java class. And if you don't know each other yet, don't be afraid — fruitful cooperation awaits you. And <code class="language-java">Runnable</code> is an interface that describes some action — any you want. In our example, <code class="language-java">Runnable</code> has an action that only prints a phrase.</p>
<p><code class="language-java">Thread</code> has several constructors, that is a normal situation, and one of its constructors take as an argument an anonymous class that implements the interface <code class="language-java">Runnable</code>. </p>
<p>As a result, the anonymous class is passed as an argument of the constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class MyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Anonymous class is created as a constructor argument
        Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Run, Forrest, run!");
            }
        });
    }
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="learn-callbacks-by-example">Learn callbacks by example</h5>
<p>Also, often, after creating an instance of an anonymous class we pass it to some method as an argument. In this case, the anonymous class is called a <strong>callback</strong>. A callback is a piece of executable code that is passed to another code that executes it (performs a call back) at a convenient time. And can we call our previous example a callback? Yes, we can — because the constructor is a special method.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example. There is a special kind of calculator that can only divide numbers. The calculator takes a callback as its argument and executes the callback passing the result of the calculation or an error message.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">Callback</code> interface has two <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an abstract method is a method that is declared in an abstract class but does not contain an implementation. | It only includes a method signature, return type, and modifiers. The abstract keyword is used to declare an abstract method. Concrete subclasses of the abstract class must provide an implementation for these abstract methods. Since an abstract class cannot be instantiated, the purpose of an abstract method is to provide a common interface for its subclasses. If a class contains an abstract method, the class must be declared abstract as well.">abstract methods</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">interface Callback {

    /**
     * Takes a result and processes it
     */
    void calculated(int result);

    /**
     * Takes an error message
     */
    void failed(String errorMsg);
}</code></pre>
<p>The class <code class="language-java">Divider</code> has only one <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static method is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. | It can be accessed directly using the class name and does not require the creation of a class instance. A static method can only access static fields and other static methods within the same class, and cannot refer to the `this` keyword because there is no instance context. Static methods are often used as utility methods that provide common functionality for the entire project. They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static method</a> (just an example, the demonstrated technique works with any methods):</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Divider {

    /**
     * Divide a by b. It executes the specified callback to process results
     */
    public static void divide(int a, int b, Callback callback) {

        if (b == 0) {
            callback.failed("Division by zero!");
            return;
        }

        callback.calculated(a / b);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Of course, in this case, you can perform the division and return the result without any callbacks. In general, though, callbacks can help you in large applications with multiple parts and layers (especially in multithreaded programs).</p>
<p>Calling a method with a callback:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class CallbacksExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        Divider.divide(a, b, new Callback() { // passing callback as an argument

            @Override
            public void calculated(int result) {
                String textToPrint = String.format("%d / %d is %d", a, b, result);
                print(textToPrint);
            }

            @Override
            public void failed(String errorMsg) {
                print(errorMsg);
            }
        });
    }

    public static void print(String text) {
        System.out.println(text);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we instantiate and pass the callback without any additional variables of the <code class="language-java">Callback</code> type. It's a very common practice for working with callbacks, especially if they are small.</p>
<p>The callback captures the static method <code class="language-java">print</code> and the local variables <code class="language-java">a</code> and <code class="language-java">b</code> from its context. The variables <code class="language-java">a</code> and <code class="language-java">b</code> are <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an effectively final variable is a variable that is not declared with the final keyword, but is assigned only once and never changed after that. | This concept is related to the use of lambda expressions in Java, where only effectively final variables can be captured and used within the lambda body. This is because lambda expressions are designed to be immutable and side-effect free, and using effectively final variables helps ensure this behavior. However, the use of the final keyword is not always necessary or desirable, as it can lead to increased boilerplate code and reduced readability.">effectively final</a> </strong>here. (i.e the variables aren't changed you don't need to write the keyword <code class="language-java">final</code> ).</p>
<p>Let's run the program.</p>
<p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an input is a component of the Java API that allows reading data from various sources, such as a console, standard input, a file, a string, or even a network connection. | Input streams can be classified into two types: byte and character. Character input streams, which are designed for reading text, encode byte to character immediately, making them suitable for text-based data. On the other hand, byte input streams are used for reading raw binary data.">Input</a> 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">8 2</code></pre>
<p>Output 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">8 / 2 is 4</code></pre>
<p>Input 2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">10 0</code></pre>
<p>Output 2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Division by zero!</code></pre>
<p>So, anonymous classes along with the context <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a capture refers to the ability of a lambda expression or an anonymous class to capture and use a variable from the context in which it is defined. | This is also known as closure. The variable being captured must be final or effectively final, meaning it cannot be changed or reassigned within the context. This feature allows for more concise and flexible code, particularly when working with interfaces or functional interfaces. Anonymous classes can also capture variables, as seen in the example of an anonymous class implementing an interface and capturing a constant field and local final variable.">capture</a> mechanism allow you to transfer logic between parts of your program. They are used as callbacks in large applications and when working with external libraries.</p>
<h5 id="restrictions-on-anonymous-classes">Restrictions on anonymous classes</h5>
<p>And, of course, anonymous classes have some restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>they cannot have static initializers or interface declarations</li>
<li>they cannot have <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static member is a class-level variable or method declared with the static keyword. | It is shared among all instances of the class, rather than being tied to individual objects, and can be accessed directly using the class name. Static members are useful for storing common values or utility methods applicable to the entire project. However, they cannot directly access non-static object fields because there is no instance context. Declaring non-final public static fields is generally not recommended as it can lead to issues with data consistency and visibility.">static members</a>, except the constant variables (<code class="language-java">final static</code> fields)</li>
<li>they cannot have constructors</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's consider the following example with an anonymous class <code class="language-java">SpeakingEntity</code>. To not have static initializers, static members, or interface declarations — it's not a big deal. But what about not having a constructor? How to initialize our fields?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">final String robotName = "Bug";
final int robotAssemblyYear = 2112;

SpeakingEntity robot = new SpeakingEntity() {

    static final int MAGIC_CONSTANT = 10;

    private String name;
    private int assemblyYear;

    { /* instance initialization block for setting fields */
        name = robotName;
        assemblyYear = robotAssemblyYear;
    }

    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("1010001" + MAGIC_CONSTANT);
    }

    @Override
    public void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("0101110" + MAGIC_CONSTANT);
    }
};</code></pre>
<p>And for examples like this one you should be friends with the good old theory! Remember about instance initializers and what they are for? Yeah, instance initializer allows us to substitute a constructor. It runs each time when an object of the class is created. So, fields <code class="language-java">name</code> and <code class="language-java">assemblyYear</code> will be initialized and our robot will have the name "Bug" and a year of birth!</p>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>Perhaps you are wondering where to go to see how anonymous classes are used in "real life"? In that case, we may have a suggestion.</p>
<p>Anonymous classes are actively used when writing user interfaces with the standard Java library called <strong>Swing</strong>. The same with developing a web user interface using <strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong>. It is very common to have a lot of listeners that are used just once for one button, so using anonymous classes allows us to avoid writing a lot of classes and having useless files in the development of the code.<br/>
Some widespread libraries for working through the <strong>HTTP</strong> protocol also use anonymous classes. For example, <a href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-asyncclient-4.1.x/quickstart.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this HttpAsyncClient</a>. </p>
<p>And the last one — what are the <strong>advantages</strong> of anonymous classes? Anonymous classes enable you to make code more concise and reduce the number of <code class="language-java">.java</code> files. And what about encapsulation? Yes, you are thinking right — each anonymous class has very local <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables, methods, and classes in the code. | The scope of a variable or method is determined by where it is declared. For example, variables declared within a block (a section of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`) are only accessible within that block. Similarly, a local inner class (a class declared within a block) has a scope that is restricted to that block. Nested classes, which include both static nested classes and local inner classes, help organize code, increase encapsulation, and can make the code more readable by hiding implementation details.">scope</a>, it is defined exactly where it is needed and it can never be used anywhere else. So, it definitely increases encapsulation and provides you with a great reason to fall in love with Java!</p>
